## Version v04

Formed a baseline.

Version **v04** includes alpha beta search with a simple piece only eval + mobility + tempo bonus.

I think the mobility bonus gave a +40 ELO and the tempo bonus another 15 ELO.  
Also check-extensions were a big win. It makes the search around 50% slower but gives better results.

These are the results of v04 with check extensions vs v03 (mobility+tempo) vs v02 (mobility).
