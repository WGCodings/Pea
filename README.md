## About

This project started as a way to get familiar with Rust around two years go — and then, as these things tend to go, it got a little bit out of hand. 
What began as tinkering with search algorithms has grown into a reasonably capable chess engine with NNUE evaluation, multithreading, and pondering support.
This is currently my third attempt to make a chess engine and again I should've done a lot of things differently, but I think it is at a stage where it is release worthy.

Move generation and board representation are handled by the [shakmaty][shakmaty] library. 
As a Rust beginner, I wanted to focus on search and evaluation first rather than getting bogged down in the details of legal move generation. 
Writing my own move generator is on the roadmap and maybe the start of my fourth attempt to make an engine?

I'm currently training two NNUEs from scratch. One with  (768 -> 1536)x2 -> 1x8 (Net 0) and one 
(768 -> 64)x2 -> 1 (Net 1). They train by constantly playing against eachother and learning from both views of the board. For more information about this progression see the CHANGELOG.md. 
You can play the latest generations of my networks on lichess : [Net 0][lichess-link0], [Net 1][lichess-link1].

The plot below shows the training progression over the generations with error bars:

## Rating

Below is a table of Elo estimates from having the engine play against other engines and itself. Time controls are listed as `time / increment`, in seconds.
[Stash][Stash] (and all its versions) have been used to estimate the rating of this engine.

## Building

Pea is made with Rust v1.93.1 and easily build with [Cargo][cargo]. Clone the repository and build from the project root.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WGCodings/Pea.git
```

**Standard build:**
```bash
cargo build --release
```

**Optimized for your CPU:**
```bash
# Windows 
$env:RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -C target-feature=+avx2,+bmi2"; cargo build --release
```

The native build enables AVX2 and BMI2 instructions and runs noticeably faster. 

**Simplest — Makefile:**

```bash
# Makefile
make release
```

---

## Usage

Running the binary directly drops you into a UCI prompt. In practice, you'll want to use a UCI-compatible frontend:

- [Arena][arena]
- [Cutechess][cutechess]
- [Shredder][shredder]

## Acknowledgements

[Simbelmyne][simbelmyne] by Sam Roelants was a major source of inspiration and learning throughout this project. A lot of ideas and how to implement them in Rust came from there.

Thanks to the communities at the **Engine Programming**  Discord servers, the Chess Programming Wiki and TalkChess forum where an enormous amount of collective knowledge lives out in the open.
